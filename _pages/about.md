## About me

I’m a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the **University of California, Irvine (UCI)**, advised by [Prof. Mohsen Imani](http://www.mohsenimani.com/). Before that, I did my M.S. in Computer Science at Texas A&M University with [Prof. Xia "Ben" Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html) and worked on knowledge-graph error detection and trustworthy data mining.

My research sits at the intersection of **trustworthy & efficient graph learning/ML** and **LLM reasoning**. I build methods that (i) **unlearn data-specific information** or **de-bias** models *without* full retraining/fine-tuning, (ii) make **graph learning** and **hyperdimensional computing (HDC)** more fair and robust, and (iii) enable LLMs to support **efficient fine-tuning** and **low-resource inference**.

Recently, I’ve been working on (first-authored):

- Privacy-aware efficient LLM. (under review)
- Efficient LLM reasoning through KGs. Using high-dimensional representations for path retrieval / KG reasoning to reduce memory and computation while preserving reasoning performance. (under review)
- Fairness on graphs / ML / LLMs. [\[WSDM’26\]](https://yezil3.github.io/) [\[WWW’25 (short)\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3701716.3715479) [\[CIKM’23 (short)\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3583780.3615176) [\[Frontiers in Big Data\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/big-data/articles/10.3389/fdata.2024.1489306/full)
- Fair and privacy-aware graph learning / ML. Fairness-aware graph unlearning / machine unlearning. [\[CIKM’25\]](https://yezil3.github.io/)
- Data-centric efficient graph learning / ML. Condensing graph/tabular data into tiny data for efficient training. [\[EUSIPCO’24\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10715024) [\[WWW’25 (short)\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3701716.3715566)
